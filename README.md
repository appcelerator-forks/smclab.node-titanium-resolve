# titanium-resolve

node.js resolve algorithm with *titanium* and [browser](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901) field support.

Itâ€™s a fork of the original [browser-resolve](https://github.com/defunctzombie/node-browser-resolve).


## Credits

Kudos to [@defunctzombie](https://github.com/defunctzombie) for the original implementation.

Humbly made by the spry ladies and gents at SMC.
